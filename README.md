Computer Science Education Week
===============================

This repository contains the files for a used to conduct a "Computer Science Education Week" event held for students in grades 9-12. The files include resources used for the five lunch-time introductory Computer Science activities as well as files for a website used to promote and conduct the event.

Most of the activities described here require hardware: a computer running a browser at the very minimum, and a Playground Express on one day. 

## Getting Started

Download the project and unzip it in a convenient directory. Then double-click on the `index.html` file in the directory `ComputerScienceEducationWeek` to launch the website in a browser. The presentations and resource materials can be examined in the browser.

## Prerequisites

An instructor leading this week-long series of meetings will want to have tried out and experimented with all of the materials in advance.

* **Day 1 - Generative Art**  
Only requires a computer with a browser and an internet connection.
* **Day 2 - WeatherWardrobe**  
Perhaps the busiest day, with students using a text editor, Python3, a private Google GMail account, and `cron` in the Terminal to write an application that texts them the weather each morning.
* **Day 3 - Playground Express**  
Writing games and demo programs using microPython on a Playground Express. Also a bit of a busy day.
* **Day 4 - How to Get Hacked**  
More of a demo day, although students may enjoy using the Terminal to create password hashes, and finding out if their email address has been "pwned"!

* **Day 5 - Coded Bias**  
This documentary exploring Joy Buolamwini's research into biased AI is gets into some important ethical conversations. Identifying a copy of the film that you can legally show students may be difficult.
