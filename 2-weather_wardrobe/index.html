        <h1>Weather Wardrobe</h1>
        <p>One of the fun things about technology is being able piece together multiple components to create something new. In this activity we'll create a program texts you in the morning to tell you how to dress for the weather that day.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h1>Note: This activity is for Apple machines.</h1>
            <p>Implementing on a PC requires additional development that will not be covered here.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="announcement"><h1>Agenda</h1>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="#1">Create a burner Google account</a></li>
            <li><a href="#2">Write and test script</a></li>

        <h2>1. Create "burner" Google account</h2>
        <p>You definitely don't want to use your official Google account for this project, so let's do this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to google.com and sign up for a new account so that we can use Gmail. The username and password don't matter, but it should be a good password. Write it down somewhere.</li>
            <li>Enable that account to use less secure apps. You can do that by going to your settings and choosing: <b>My Account > Sign-in & security > Allow less secure apps: ON</b></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Confirm that you can log into the account, then log out. You'll be using this account to send emails/texts to yourself.</p>
        
        <div id="2"></div> 
        <h2>2. Write and test script</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You're going to have a program that runs on your computer, and we need a place to put it. The Desktop works fine, or your Documents folder.</li>
            <li>Launch the <b>TextEdit</b> app on your Apple laptop, open up Preferences and change the default format to "Plain text." We're going to be editing the program that will make this application work.</li>
            <li>Right-click or control-click to <a href="./weather_wardrobe.py">download</a> this file and move it onto your Desktop.</li>
            <li>With TextEdit, open up the file you downloaded. Then edit the code to make the following changes:
                <ol>
                    <li>put your burner email address in the appropriate space</li>
                    <li>put your password in the appropriate location</li>
                    <li>pout your custom weather messages in there</li>
                    <li>Put your Poly email address in the appropriate location. (We'll change this to your cellphone number after testing.)</li>
                </ol>
            Then save the file.</li>
            <li>Run the script
                <ol>
                    <li>Launch a Terminal app on your phone</li>
                    <li>Type <span class="ilc">which python</span> in the terminal and copy the message that gets displayed. Then use that information to run the program as shown:
                    <div class="code">% which python
/opt/anaconda3/bin/python
% /opt/anaconda3/bin/python /Users/$USER/Desktop/weather_wardrobe.py</div>
                    If the program works correctly, you should see a message displayed in your terminal window. You should <i>also</i> receive an email at your Poly email.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <div id="3"></div>            
        <h2>3. Sending email to your phone</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cellphone carries usually allow emails to be sent to your phone using a specially-formatted email address.</li>
            <li>Start with your cellphone number. I'll use 626-845-1235 and take out the dashes: 6268451235.</li>
            <li>Add the appropriate domain name as specified by your cellphone carrier:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Verizon: 6268451235@vtext.com</li>
                <li>T-Mobile: 6268451235@tmomail.net</li>
                <li>AT&T: 6268451235@txt.att.net</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Using TextEdit, change the email in the program from your Poly email to your cellphone number as described above. Save this new version of the program.</li>
            <li>Using the Terminal, try running the program again:
            <div class="code">% /opt/anaconda3/bin/python /Users/$USER/Desktop/weather_wardrobe.py</div></li>
            You should get text message on your phone with the message from the program!</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div id="4"></div>            
        <h2>4. Set up <span class="ilc">crontab</span></h2>
        <p>Here's the tricky part: getting your script to run automatically every morning!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Back in the Terminal again, copy the command that you used to run the program. Then...</li>
            <li>Open up the <span class="ilc">crontab</span> program that we can use to run programs at any specified day and time.
            <div class="code">% export EDITOR=nano
% crontab -e</div></li>
            <li>Enter the following line into the crontab:
            <div class="code">00 12 * * 1-5 /opt/anaconda3/bin/python /Users/$USER/Desktop/weather_wardrobe.py</div>
            This will try to automatically run the program at 12:00. After entering the line, hit ctrl-O to save the file, Y to accept the filename, then ctrl-X to exit the text editor.</li>
            <li>Wait a moment and see if it works!</li>
            <li>To run the program in the morning, change the "00 12" to "00 7" for 7am, and you'll get your text message with the weather every weekeday morning!</li>
        </ol>
