                <h1>Workshop: Generative Art</h1>
                <p>There are lots of ways to create art, and lots of ways to learn about programming. In this workshop we're going to use the "Processing" platform on your computer to draw pictures, create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative art</a>, and write/play graphics-based games.</p>
                
                <div class="announcement"><h1>Agenda</h1>

                <h1 id="1">1.1. The Processing platform for JavaScript</h1>
                <p><i>Processing</i> is a library created to allow artists and programmers to create visual "sketches" by using code.</p>
                <p>You can learn more about processing at <a href="https://processing.org">processing.org</a>. You can learn about using the JavaScript programming language with Processing at <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5js.org</a>.</p>
                <p>But what you <i>really</i> want to do is just get started by using the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">online p5js editor</a>.</p>
                <p>Let's go!</p>
                
                <h1>1.2. The editor interface</h1>
                <p>Using your browser, go to <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">editor.p5js.org</a>. You'll see an online interface that looks like this:</p>
                <img src="./grfx/p5-1.png" />
                <p>The left half of the screen is dedicated to <b>writing code</b>, and the right half of the screen will display a <b>Preview</b> of the visual results of that code whenever we click on the gray "Play" button at the upper left corner of the window. There is also a small "Console" window below our code that we can use to help debug our code.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on the gray "Play" button now to see what happens.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You should see a gray square area appear in the Preview window on the right. The code is running! (Not that there's much to see at this point.)</p>
                <p>Click the "Stop" square, and click on "Sign Up" to create an account with your <b>polytechnic.org</b> Google account.</p>
                <p>Now we're ready to get started.</p>
                
                <h1>1.3. <span class="ilc">setup()</span> and <span class="ilc">draw()</span> functions</h1>
                <p>A <i>function</i> in programming is a just the name for a chunk of code that does something. In our Processing work there are two important functions for writing our "sketches":</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The <span class="ilc">setup()</span> function is executed once when the code begins running. This is usually where the Canvas is created (see below) and initial background colors are set up. Variables are declared and initialized in the space above the <span class="ilc">setup()</span> function.</li>
                  <li>The <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function is executed next, and this is where most of the interesting code will go. <b>Note</b>: <i>The <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function is executed repeatedly in a type of infinite loop</i>. As soon as all the code is executed once, the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function runs again, over and over until the program is stopped.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This will allow us to write some really interesting programs!</p>
                <p>Add the lines to your sketch as shown in the screenshot here. Then click the "Play" button. You should see the value of test repeatedly printed out in the Console, confirming that the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function is being repeatedly run, over and over again.</p>
                <img src="./grfx/p5-2.png" />
                <p>Stop the program and delete those three lines before continuing with our exploration.</p>
                
                <h1>1.4. The canvas, background, and colors</h1>
                <p>The <i>canvas</i> represents the area that is available for us to draw on. Currently, it is specified as 400 pixels wide and 400 pixels tall. Let's change the canvas to 600 pixels by 400 pixels:</p>
                <div class="code">createCanvas(600, 400);</div>
                <p>Run the sketch again and you should see the gray-colored canvas as a landscape-oriented rectangle.</p>
                <p>The term <i>pixel</i> refers to a "picture element" on the screen, one "dot" of light on your screen. A single point of light on a computer screen is not very large, but the p5.js environment allows us to keep track of them all and use them in creating our sketches.</p>
                <p>The <span class="ilc">background()</span> instruction specifies the color of the canvas's background. The parameter is currently set to 220, but it can be specified as something else, in one of two ways.</p>
                <p>If you're just working with different black-gray-white shades, the value can be anything from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Here, 220 is pretty close to 255, so it's a light gray color. Try changing it to a lower number&mdash;maybe 80?&mdash;and run the program again to see what the background looks like now.</p>
                <h2>1.4.1. Colors</h2>
                <img src="./grfx/1000px-AdditiveColor.svg-atribution-none.png" class="half_right" />
                <p>Of course what we <i>really</i> want to be able to use is colors, and these can be specified in a few ways. The easiest perhaps, is using Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values.</p>
                 <p>The primary light colors are red, green, and blue, and by combining these colors in varying degrees, all the colors of the rainbow can be produced.</p>
                <p>The diagram to the right indicates that red light and green light, when combined, will produce a yellow color. (If you were to combine red and green <i>pigments</i>, on the other hand, you'd have a brown/gray mess.)</p>
                <p>To specify different colors for use in your artwork you can indicate how much of each primary color&mdash;red, green, and blue&mdash;you wish to use, with a value from 0-255.</p>
                <div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
                <p>So, if you want "red" to be the background of your window, you'd use the instruction</p>
                <div class="code">background(255, 0, 0);    // red, green, and blue values</div>
                <p>To specify a magenta color, you'd use the instruction</p>
                <div class="code">background(255, 0, 255);    // all red, no green, all blue = magenta</div>
                <p>Crazy background colors are interesting, but most sketches use a simple black, white, or gray background, however, and save the use of color for the other elements on the screen.</p>
                
                <h1 id="2">2. Making drawings</h1>
                <p>Although it's not really <i>generative art</i>, let's learn about the pixels on the page by creating some simple drawings.</p>
                <h1>2.1 Orienting yourself in the window</h1>
                <p>Each "picture element," or <i>pixel</i> on the screen, can be individually specified by its <i>column</i> and <i>row</i>. Columns are numbered from left to right, from 0 to <i>width</i> - 1 across the screen, and rows are numbered top to bottom, from 0 to <i>height</i> - 1, down the screen.</p>
                <p>For a 640 &times; 480 window, the coordinates would look like this.</p>
                <img src="./grfx/window_coords.jpg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: 1em auto;" />
                
                <h1>2.2. Setting the Fill; Drawing Shapes</h1>
                <p>In order to be able to draw on the screen, we can use a number of built-in functions. To use these you'll typically need to specify a number of parameters.</p>
                <p>The <span class="ilc">ellipse(x, y, width, height)</span> function, for example, draws an ellipse on the screen.</p>
                <p>Copy this script into the sketch window and try running it:</p>
                <div class="code">function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  strokeWeight(2);    // sets the width of the line
  stroke(0, 0, 255);  // sets the color of the line
  fill(255, 0, 0);    // sets color for next element
  ellipse(100, 200, 50, 30);  // draws a shape
}</div>
                <img src="./grfx/ellipse.png" class="half_center" />
                <p>Notice that the stroke weight (line thickness) is "2" and that it has a blue color (0, 0, 255). The body of the ellipse has a fill that is red (255, 0, 0), and the ellipse is located at x=100, y=200, on the screen, and has a width of 50 pixels and a height of 30 pixels.</p>
                <p>Each of these <i>fill</i> and <i>stroke</i> commands needs to be given <i>before</i> a line or shape is drawn. Once the fill/stroke have been changed, those new values will continue until they are reset again.</p>
                <div class="code">stroke(0-255);         // defines the grayscale color of a line
stroke(r, g, b);       // describes an RGB line color
strokeWeight(3);       // describes the width of the stroke
noStroke();            // removes the stroke color completely
fill(0-255);           // describes a grayscale fill color
fill(r, g, b);         // describes an RGB fill color
noFill();              // removes the fill color completely</div>

                <p>Here are a few shapes to experiment with:</p>
                <div class="code">ellipse(centerX, centerY, width, height)
point(X, Y);                          // highlights a point in canvas
triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3);     // creates triangle with these vertices
quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4); // creates a quadrilateral
rect(x, y, width, height);            // creates a rectangle
line(x1, y1, x2, y2);                 // creates a line</div>
            
                <h1>2.3. Planning a drawing</h1>
                <p>At this point, we can issue commands to draw a simple picture. Consider drawing a simple house with the sun shining down on it. To save myself a lot of trouble, I'd plan out the sketch by drawing it on graph paper first...</p>
                <img src="./grfx/p5-3.png" />
                <p>I've identified important pixels in that diagram, and some shapes and colors. Then I could write the code to make that happen.</p>
                <div class="code">function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  line(50,300,550,300);
  rect(100,200,200,100);
  triangle(200,100,100,200,300,200);
  circle(500,80,80);
}</div>
                <p>When I entered that code and ran it, I realized the sun was too small, so I made the radius a little bigger:</p>
                <img src="./grfx/p5-4.png" />
                <p>It needs some color, though. Yes? Set the different fills <i>before</i> each shape gets drawn:</p>
                <div class="code">function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  line(50,300,550,300);
  fill(255, 0, 100);     // not sure what color this is -- lol
  rect(100,200,200,100); // house
  fill(0);              // black
  triangle(200,100,100,200,300,200); // roof
  fill(255, 255, 0);    // yellow for the sun
  circle(500,80,80);
  // Adding a door
  fill(140, 140, 0);
  rect(120, 240, 30, 60);
}</div>
                <p>Notice I added a door there to make it look a little more like a house.</p>
                <img src="./grfx/p5-5.png" />
                
                <h2>2.3.1. Reminder: <span class="ilc">draw()</span> runs continuously</h2>
                <p>Although you can't really tell in this sketch, the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function is redrawing this picture approximately 30 times a second. We can see that by making one small change in our sketch.</p>
                <p>Instead of creating a <i>yellow</i> fill for the sun, let's make a random color for the sun:</p>
                <div class="code">fill(random(256), random(256), random(256));</div>
                <p>This chooses a random number 0-255 for the red value, 0-255 for the green value, and 0-255 for the blue value, to create a random color that is used for the fill. A new random color is chosen every time we run this <span class="ilc">fill</span> instruction, which happens ~30 times a second!</p>
                <p>Try it!</p>
                <div class="code">function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  line(50,300,550,300);
  fill(255, 0, 100);     // not sure what color this is -- lol
  rect(100,200,200,100); // house
  fill(0);              // black
  triangle(200,100,100,200,300,200); // roof
  <span class="codehighlight">// random color for the sun
  fill(random(256), random(256), random(256));</span>
  circle(500,80,80);
  // Adding a door
  fill(140, 140, 0);
  rect(120, 240, 30, 60);
}</div>

                <p>One more example of how we can use the repeating <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function.</p>
                
                <h1>2.4. How animation works</h1>
                <p>When we redraw the screen some 30 times every second, we can produce an animation: draw an image, then draw a slightly different image, then draw another slightly different image...</p>
                <p>In this version of the program, the sun's horizontal position <span class="ilc">x</span> starts at 0 and increases by 2 every time the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function runs.</p>
                <div class="code"><span class="codehighlight">let x = 0;   // x-coordinate for the sun</span>
                                
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  line(50,300,550,300);
  fill(255, 0, 100);     // not sure what color this is -- lol
  rect(100,200,200,100); // house
  fill(0);              // black
  triangle(200,100,100,200,300,200); // roof
  // random color for the sun
  fill(random(256), random(256), random(256));    
  <span class="codehighlight">circle(x,80,80);   // drawing the sun at the x-coordinate
  x = x + 2          // move the sun over 2 pixels for next time</span>
  // Adding a door
  fill(140, 140, 0);
  rect(120, 240, 30, 60);
}</div>
                                <p>Note that the sun moves across the sky and passes in front of the house. Can you figure out how to fix that issue?</p>
                                <img src="./grfx/p5-6.png" />
                
                <p>The command <span class="ilc">background(220);</span> in our program clears the screen every time it is called, just before we draw the house in its same position and the sun in a slightly different position.</p>
                <p>To see what happens when we <i>don't</i> clear the screen, remove that <span class="ilc">background(220)</span> command (or comment it out) and see how it effects the running of your program.</p>
                <div class="code">function draw() {

                <h1 id="3">3. Generative Art</h1>
                
                <h1>3.1. What is generative art?</h1>
                <p><i>Generative art</i> is typically considered as art that, at least in part, has been created with using an "autonomous system" such as a mechanism or machine. One type of generative art is <i>algorithmic art</i>, in which the art has been created with the assistance of a computer program.</p>
                <p>The French artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Molnár">Vera Moln&agrave;r</a> was one of the first artists using computer algorithms as a medium.</p>
                <figure><img src="https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/erFvH2iKIS41YNX3-9cC0A/large.jpg"><figcaption>Vera Moln&agrave;r</figcaption></figure>
                <figure><img src="https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/dvSsGov4m7w8fpdp6_nX_A/large.jpg"><figcaption>Untitled (6), 1972<br />Vera Moln&agrave;r</figcaption></figure>
                
                <div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
                <p>We're almost ready to create some generative art of our own. Let's learn about <i>event listeners</i>, and see if we can make our programs interactive.</p>
                <h1>3.2. Using "event listeners"</h1>
                <p>The previous program demonstrates how we can create simple animations, but we also want to have the user interact with our program.</p>
                <h2>3.2.1. <span class="ilc">mouseX</span> and <span class="ilc">mouseY</span> events</h2>
                <p>Clear out the code you've written and try this program:</p>
                <div class="code">function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);    // clear background
  fill(255, 0, 0);    // set red fill for circle
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);   // draw circle at mouse
  console.log(mouseX, mouseY);  // display mouse loc
}</div>
                <p>In this script, <span class="ilc">mouseX</span> and <span class="ilc">mouseY</span> are two values that indicate the x,y location on the screen. In this version of the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function we're both drawing the circle at whatever location the mouse is located, and printing out those coordinates in the Console window (if you want to see their numeric value).</p>
                <p>We say that the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function is "listening" for mouse events. If the mouse moves, if the mouse button is pressed, or if the mouse button is released, that information can be relayed to the script and our program can act on that information.</p>
                
                <h2>3.2.2. Interacting with mouse clicks</h2>
                <p>There are two common ways of interacting with a mouseclick.</p>
                <p>One is the <span class="ilc">mousePressed</span> boolean variable, which is <span class="ilc">true</span> if the mouse is down. Change your <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function so that it looks like this:</p>
                <div class="code">function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

                <p>This version of the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function only puts a circle on the screen while the mouse button is pressed. If you move the mouse while the mouse is pressed, Processing will continue to put ellipses on the screen.</p>
                <p>Because we're clearing the screen every time through the <span class="ilc">draw()</span> function, we don't see the old circles on the screen. If you comment out the <span class="ilc">background(220);</span> line then we won't clear the screen. Try that out and see what happens.</p>
                
                <p>A second way of interacting with the mouse captures individual clicks. Just as Processing knows about the <span class="ilc">setup()</span> and <span class="ilc">draw()</span> functions, it looks for a <span class="ilc">mouseClicked()</span> function. If a <span class="ilc">mouseClicked()</span> function is defined for a program, then Processing will automatically call that function anytime the mouse is clicked.</p>
                <p>Make the changes highlighted below to see an example of using <span class="ilc">mouseClicked()</span>.</p>

                <p>The programs that we've written so far allow us to create images on the screen based on using the mouse and mouse-clicks. Another type of computer art is <i>generative art</i>, in which the <i>program</i> (written by us, and perhaps manipulated by us), creates the art.</p>
                <p>This program uses pseudorandom values and Perlin "noise" to create random endpoints for a line, and repeatedly changes those endpoints.</p>
                <p>Enter the program into Processing and run it.</p>
                <p>Is this art?</p>

                <p>If you're writing programs that produce images that you want to capture, here's another use for the <span class="ilc">mouseClicked()</span> function:</p>
